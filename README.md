This HTML and JavaScript code creates a simple menu website where users can view different food items and their prices. This code creates a basic menu website with interactive features for browsing different food items. Here's an explanation of the code:

# HTML Structure:

- The HTML file starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, indicating that this is an HTML5 document.
- Inside the `<head>` section, there are meta tags for defining the character set and viewport settings, as well as a title for the webpage.
- External CSS and Bootstrap Icons libraries are linked using `<link>` tags.
- The `<body>` section contains the main content of the webpage, including the header, navigation, sections, and footer.

## Header Section:

- The `<header>` contains the logo, navigation menu, and a section for displaying the current food item.
- The logo and navigation menu are wrapped inside a `<nav>` element.
- The left menu links are placed inside a `<div>` with the class `left_menu`.
- Inside the `<section>`, there is a `<div>` with the class `content` for displaying the current food item's title, description, and price.
- Below the content div, there is another `<div>` with the class `cards`, which contains multiple food cards.

## JavaScript (app.js):

- The JavaScript code starts by selecting the left and right arrow icons for scrolling through the food cards and the container div for the food cards.
- Event listeners are added to the left and right arrow icons to scroll the container div left or right when clicked.
- An event listener is added to each food card, so when a card is clicked, its image, title, and price are displayed in the content div at the top.

### Explanation of Specific Parts:

- The `scrollLeft` property is used to scroll the container horizontally.
- The `poster`, `title`, and `price_cont` variables are used to reference the elements that will display the current food item's image, title, and price, respectively.
- The `Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName('card'))` loop iterates over each food card and adds a click event listener to each one. When a card is clicked, it updates the content at the top of the page with the details of the selected food item.
